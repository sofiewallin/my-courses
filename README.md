# Courses web application

A web application listing the courses that are included in my education with the help of the web service in this repo: https://github.com/sofiewallin/api-courses. 

This is part of a school assignment where I'm learning how to build a REST web service with PHP and use it.

## Using the application

The application is published at: https://studenter.miun.se/~sowa2002/dt173g/kursmoment5-app/

The publication is built with HTML, Sass and TypeScript in a Git and webpack environment. It reads all the courses that are in the web service and there's also a form for creating courses in the web service. Try out the form and add a course to the list.

## Developing the application
To start up the system and the included loaders and plugins follow these steps:

- Open a terminal/command prompt
- Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/sofiewallin/my-courses.git`
- Enter repository and run `npm install`
- Run development and start live reload in browser with `npm start`
- Build production folder with `npm run build`
